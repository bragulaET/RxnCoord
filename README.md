This is a simple Julia script designed to produce reaction coordinate diagrams. The user will need to input each of their desired energies in the order that they would like them to appear on the diagram into vector at the start of the script. The only requirement is the Julia package Plots.jl which will need to be installed in order to produce the diagrams.
